            <h1>About Me:</h1>
            <p>Good day! My name is Caio Broering Pinho and I'm a programming and technology enthusiast. I am currently studying Information Systems at UFSC (Federal University of Santa Catarina), with the aim of improving my knowledge in the technology area and connecting with people who share the same interest.
            </p>
            <p>My passion for programming led me to explore different personal projects that were hosted in my GitHub repository. Among these projects, I created from gravity simulators to games like Snake Game and Flappy Bird implemented using artificial intelligence to make these experiences even more engaging.</p>
